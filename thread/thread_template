[SIZE=5][B]About Project:[/B][/SIZE] 
   
Cardinal-AOSP is a Custom ROM which was initially based on AOSPB, then we changed our mind and rebased it to AOSP-RRO, to get better compatibility with most of the devices. And now we are based on AOSP on oreo.  The main aim of this ROM is to bring stock AOSP experience as much as possible while maintaining performance, smoothness and good battery backup.   I hope that you'll all love this project, and help us, shape it even more better.   Meanwhile, all of our sources are publicly available on our Github. We also do own a Google+ Community, where you can.... uhm... you know, do  what all others do at forums and communities!  Hope you enjoy your stay and  like our work on Cardinal-AOSP.  [COLOR=red]
